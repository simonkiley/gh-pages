Heavily inspired by [Michael Pecirno's](http://www.michaelpecirno.com/) minimalist maps of the US, the *Canada Below 60°N* project aims to display land use data in a minimalist map setting with no background layers, boundary features, or labels. 

The raster data covers Canada below the 60th parallel and has a 30m cell size, coming in at a total (uncompressed) size of about 85GB. There are **7,772,100,116** individual cells in this dataset.
